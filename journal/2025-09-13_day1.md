# Journal — 2025-09-13 — Day 1: SQL and ELT Basics

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- The work of a DE overlaps with different roles:
  * DBAs
  * DAs/Data Scientists
  * DevOps/Software Engineers
- DE work evolves with
    * Extract -> Transform -> Load
    * Create pipelines to ensure that raw data collected becomes useful, consistent and reliable when it reaches the intended user (eg., Data Analysts/Data Scientists) in order to help the decision maker of the business.

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **ingest** — extract and load the raw data to the data warehouse for further transformation
- **pipeline** - the method or the flow of how the data are process end to end.  
- **data mart** - a data warehouse intended for specific use
- **OLAP** - use for analytical purposes like when a data analyst create or generate reports for further analysis. This is where the DE and DA do their data processing.
- **OLTP** - for production, use in transaction or operations. It's not advisable to use it for data processing/analysis since it's being used realtime by business operations on their day-to-day transactions.
- **ELT** - Extract Load Transform; quicker but messy since data is loaded even if it's not been fully validated.
- **ETL** - Etract Transform Load; more complicated and slower since data is being cleaned up and processed before it is loaded to the data warehouse.


## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Move data once!

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- For an example exercise, I did X, because of Y

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- huhuhu, what is a data lake?

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] Practice more in creating complex queries.
- [ ] Read more about data pipelines to better understand how it works.

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
What surprised me? What would I do differently next time? What will I watch out for in production?

**Data Engineering for me is simple and complex. Simple to understand but complex when doing it in actual. Although a DE works in the background  most of the time, being a DE rocks. This makes me realized that somehow DE is meant for me? We'll see...** 


### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
